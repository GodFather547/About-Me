- 👋 Hello Everyone!

- 👀 I’m a YouTuber who is doing programming for more than 3 years 
     because I love coding because I believe it is the future of computer industry.

- 🌱 I’m also a human and is not perfect at programming. 
     Learning never ends, so I explore many topics in various fields of programming like Game and Application Development.

- 💞️ I’m looking forward to help many people who are interested in programming.
     Some people find programming very hard and quit which results in the computer industry losing brilliant minds.

- 📫 You can join my discord server to have a discussion with me.

- 😄 I will be posting all the files related to my YouTube channel and other things like
     Projects, Applications, Websites, Code Snippets, Games and many more!
